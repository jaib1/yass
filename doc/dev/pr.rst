Pull requests
=============

Once your fix/feature is finished is time to open a pull request, the
process will be as follows, let's suppose you are developing a new
feature in the ``new-feature`` branch:

1. Make sure ``new-feature`` branch passes all the tests
2. Open pull request to merge to the ``master`` branch
3. A reviewer will go through your code and suggest chances if necessary
4. You will address those suggestions and push the updated code to
   ``new-feature``
5. The pull request is updated automatically
6. A reviewer will go through the pull request, if no more changes are
   required it will accept your pull request
7. The new feature is now available in the ``master`` branch
